# The `cli` tier's gate refuses what it exists to refuse (scripts/test-cli.sh).
#
# A gate that has never been seen to fail is indistinguishable from no gate,
# so each refusal is driven here with stand-ins on a PATH built for the
# purpose -- no build, no cargo:
#
#   - no rust-fs-ntfs on PATH: the tier fails naming `chore cli:install`
#     and the brew line, and runs nothing;
#   - a rust-fs-ntfs that is someone else's: fails, naming the path;
#   - ours, but doctor finds a shadowed name: fails with doctor's report and
#     tests nothing;
#   - a test file that exits 0 without its trailing line: fails, because it
#     stopped early;
#   - a file that exits non-zero: fails;
#   - every file passing, but fewer checks executed than the floor: fails;
#   - and the good path passes, so the refusals are not a tier that always
#     fails.
