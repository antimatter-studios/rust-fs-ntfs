#
# Package the built command-line tools as a release tarball in the current
# directory, check it, and print its file name on stdout.
#
#   <version>     the release version, without the leading `v`
#   <label>       the platform, e.g. darwin-arm64 or linux-x86_64
#   [target-dir]  where cargo put the release build (default: target/release)
#
# THE TARBALL IS THE CONTRACT with whatever installs it. Its layout is a
# prefix, so an installer copies it as-is and needs to know nothing about
# which tools are in it:
#
#   bin/<tool>...               every command-line tool, under its public name
#   share/<repo>/CAVEATS        a few lines an installer shows after install
#   LICENSE-MIT, LICENSE-APACHE
#
# Man pages and shell completions, when there are any, go under share/ the
# same way. <repo> is the repository's name, from Cargo.toml's `repository`.
#
# TOOLS ARE RENAMED HERE. Cargo refuses a dot in a target name, so the
# formatter's target is `mkfs_ntfs` and its public name is `mkfs.ntfs`, the
# one the tooling convention uses and `mkfs -t ntfs` resolves to. The
# underscore is a build-system constraint and has no business in a public
# artifact. `rust-ntfs`, the CLI the test matrix drives, is not shipped.
#
# THEN IT CHECKS WHAT IT BUILT, because a tarball whose tools do not run is
# worse than no tarball: the failure would surface as a user's bug report
# rather than a red release. The member list must be exactly the intended
# one, and every tool must answer --help and report `<tool> (<crate>)
# <version>` from --version, which identifies it among same-named tools
# from other packages and catches a tag that disagrees with Cargo.toml. On
# any failure nothing is printed on stdout and the tarball is removed.
# tests/scripts/package-cli.sh holds this script to all of that.
